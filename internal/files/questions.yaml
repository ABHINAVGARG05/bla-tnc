  - question: "In the mystical town of Spellhaven, Grand Sorceress Elara discovers a prophecy referencing the number 7 in various magical contexts. Each interpretation of 7—seventh celestial sphere, prime magical constant, mystic power of unity, and Forgotten Hex spell system—remains 7 in hexadecimal. Summing these values, she finds 1C in hex. This result, 1C, is key to unlocking the spell needed to avert the looming catastrophe. The sorceress translates this into base 7 to understand more. What did she find?"

  - question: "In a futuristic materials research lab, a team of engineers is developing a new composite material for spacecraft. To store information about the material's properties, they use Python to catalog its technical data. One of the engineers, Alex, writes the following line of code to store the material's strength and density: technical_data = {'strength': 115.5, 'density': 15.1}, print (technical_data). Later, another engineer, Maya, enters the lab and suggests a slightly different way to write the same information: technical_data = dict(strength=115.5, density=15.1), print(technical_data). How many elements are common in both technical data?"

  - question: "The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers: n→n/2 (n is even) and n→3n+1 (n is odd). Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence: 13→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1. It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. What is the smallest number that will contain 87 terms?"
